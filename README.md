## Room for Improvement
###Using Git to upload your changes:
- Finish modifying 
    -> git add <br />
    -> git commit -m "This is my second changes for text color and background images"<br />
    -> git push<br />

- When you see the changes in your github repository<br />
    -> Go to Netlify site<br />
    click "Sites" from heading menu<br />
    click your website<br />
    click "Deploys" from heading menu<br />
    click "Triger Deploy" and dropdown menu comes up<br />

    *"Clear cache and deploy site" is for clearing the server cashe and take longer 
    when you deploy too many times. Basicly both does same.
